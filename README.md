Integrating Redux into a React app
</h1>

Steps to integrate Redux into an existing React app are

Setup up Redux

    * Install the redux npm packages
    * Define your actions
    * Define your reducers
    * Create your store

Update components

    * use store.subscribe to listen for store updates
    * call store.getState to retrive state for rendering
    * call store.dispatch to dispatch actions to the store

Note: You'll start with writing all of the code to interact with the store within each component that needs to render state from the store or to dispatch actions.
